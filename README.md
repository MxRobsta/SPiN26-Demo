# CHiME-9 ECHI Listening Test Demo

Hello! Welcome to the demo for the CHiME-9 ECHI Listening Tests at SPiN 2026.

The aim of this listening test is to assess the intelligibility of
conversational audio by retyping utterances from a target speaker. These tests
will be used to rank speech enhancement systems for the CHiME-9 ECHI Challenge.

To cue the target speaker's voice, you will have a clean example of their
speech, followed by two examples of the listening test: the first uses audio
recorded on Aria glasses (more challenging), and the second uses audio recorded
on close-talk microphones (easier).

For each example, listen to the full audio sample, then transcribe the audio
heard during the "Transcribe Here". When you're done, you can show the true
answer and listen to the close-talk microphone sample.

Please read the provided transcripts before starting the sample.
