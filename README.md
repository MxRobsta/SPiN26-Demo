# CHiME-9 ECHI Listening Test Demo

Hello! Welcome to the demo for the CHiME-9 ECHI Listening Tests at SPiN 2026.

The aim of this listening test is to assess the intelligibility of
conversational audio by retyping utterances from a target speaker. These tests
will be used to rank speech enhancement systems for the CHiME-9 ECHI Challenge.

To cue the target speaker's voice, you will have a clean example of their
speech, followed by two examples of the listening test: the first uses audio
recorded on Aria glasses (more challenging), and the second uses audio recorded
on close-talk microphones (easier).
